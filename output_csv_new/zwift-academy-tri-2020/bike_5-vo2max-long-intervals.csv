"For the final bike workout of Zwift Academy Tri, we’re getting into long VO2 intervals. Typically, long VO2 intervals include anything where the reps are over 1 minute in duration. They’re not usually as intense as short VO2 intervals, although they should still be higher than your FTP. With these, there is more of a focus on both the anaerobic and aerobic systems. For triathletes, these are the sessions you should be including in your main training block before a competition.        This session comes with a bit of a twist. The first minute is over FTP at 110% before settling a little lower, but still above FTP for 2 minutes. Recent studies have shown that intervals with variable intensity have a greater training effect than maintaining just one level of intensity all the way through.        For WHOOP users - This workout is ideally done on a Green Recovery day. VO2max sessions are aimed to push you, and this workout is no different. If you aren’t well recovered, get some rest and tackle this workout on another day.",1,600,45,75,%,,,,,,
