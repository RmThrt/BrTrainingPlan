"This is a very tough session and not many people are able to complete it on first attempt - so don't be disheartened if you cannot. It is designed to stretch you to your fullest - taking you to your upper limit of aerobic powers and forcing you to recover at your threshold. Ensure you have a good quality, powerful fan during this session, you WILL get hot and you will need good airflow on the indoor trainer.",1,900,25,85,%,,,,,,
