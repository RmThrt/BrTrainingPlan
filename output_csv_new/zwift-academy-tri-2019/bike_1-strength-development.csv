"Sport specific strength is a critical component of long-distance triathlon. This session aims to produce large amounts of muscular force with limited disturbance to the cardiovascular systems. Many professional long-distance triathletes include regular strength endurance work as part of their micro-cycle routines. And for good reason. Research has shown that training at a lower cadence produced more significant power benefits at threshold than training at a higher cadence.These types of sessions are great if you've got tired legs but still want some quality. This session in particular is made up of 5 x 8 minute reps where the cadence is kept low (60-75 rpm), with moderate intensity (78-84% of FTP).",1,120,50,50,%,,,,,,
