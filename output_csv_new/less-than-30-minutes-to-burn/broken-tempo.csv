"Tempo runs are a great way to improve lactate threshold and allow athletes to sustain faster paces for longer amounts of time. Ideally, they are paced at your one-hour effort and will feel fast, but relaxed. In this workout, we'll start with an easy warm up before jumping into five 3-minute tempo efforts with 30 second rest breaks in between. When you're finished, make sure to cool down for better recovery, less pain, and improved performance.",1,480,65,80,%,,,,,,
