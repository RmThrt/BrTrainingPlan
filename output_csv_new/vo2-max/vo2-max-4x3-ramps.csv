"We're back to working at VO2 Max intensity today, but this time we're aiming for 12min and using a steady state interval again. The plan is to ramp up through the entire VO2 Max range and maintain a high cadence throughout. REMINDER: You can always adjust the FTP bias via the arrow keys on your keyboard, or the Zwift Companion app. Once you get over threshold, using a %FTP for workout prescription can get murky, so always adjust as needed.",1,300,40,75,%,,,,,,
