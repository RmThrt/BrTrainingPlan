"In today's workout, you will complete a 15 minute 'Free Ride', 5 x short blocks of Threshold (Zone 4) before finishing with a ramped effort right up to Zone 6. Rapha Cycling Club (RCC) was founded in 2015.This is a really varied workout to keep your mind engaged and body working hard. The key block is the 15 minute free ride - will you push hard, or take it steady? Your answer should depend on how much you want the Festive 500? If you want it - go hard, to give yourself a big training stress in this final workout.",1,480,35,95,%,,,,,,
