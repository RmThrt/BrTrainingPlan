"This dynamic workout focuses on two critical power durations, 30-second and 2-minute. 30-second, anaerobic efforts hone your ability to do short, explosive efforts in quick succession—mimicking attack covering and punchy courses. 2-minute efforts simulate the high-pressure moments that often dictate race-winning scenarios—late-race attacks, final climbs, etc. By intertwining these two components, this workout equips you with the fitness for race-winning efforts.",1,120,60,60,%,,,,,,
