"So you think you have what it takes to take on the Norseman Workout Series? One way or another, if you race Norseman, you are going to end up in Gaustablikk. This is where the finish hotel is located but it is also the finish line for the white jersey finishers. Those who did not make the cut off to go all the way to the top of the mountain. No shame there, you still run the same distance but the last few miles are relatively flat. If you made it to the top, the hotel in Gautablikk is where the cold beer is waiting for you on your return.	This workout starts with a 10 minute warm up period and then straight into the main set. The main set consists of two round of 3 minute, 2 minute, and 1 minute hill repeats. Simple enough. No frills, just hard work. In-game messaging will direct your treadmill incline changes. Once you've given it your all, we will be gracious enough to give you a 5min cool down.	Think you have what it takes? Check out all of the Norseman Run and Bike workouts to help you prepare for the Norseman Festival of Climbing July 27th - August 2nd.",1,480,65,80,%,,,,,,
