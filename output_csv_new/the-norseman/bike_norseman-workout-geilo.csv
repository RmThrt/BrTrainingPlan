So you think you have what it takes to take on the Norseman Workout Series? Geilo marks the end of the mountain plateau. This is a good place for your support crew to restock on supplies. You will take a right turn and 3 big climbs lie between you and the end of the bike.  As you would expect this is another climbing focussed workout. 4 x 10.5 minute climbs that gradually ramp up with the hardest effort at the end of each climb. This is a good workout to focus on smooth pedaling and good posture during seated climbs.	Think you have what it takes?
