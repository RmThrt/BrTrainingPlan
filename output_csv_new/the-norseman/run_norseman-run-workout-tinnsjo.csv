"So you think you have what it takes to take on the Norseman Workout Series? The first half of the run is mostly along the banks of Lake Tinnsjo. If you are lucky it will be a good temperature for running, sunny but not too hot. The locals smile and wave, in sympathy mostly, they know what lies waiting a few miles up the road.This run workout is designed to build your speed and fitness. The Norseman may be know for its final climb, but you also have 16 miles of flat road that we want you to be able to float across! 	This workout starts with a 10 minute progressive warm up followed by two 30 second strides to get the heart rate up and the legs prepped. The main set is made up of three 6 minute tempo builds. Nice and simple, just you and the hard work ahead. The workout will then wrap up with 5 minutes of decreasing effort.	Think you have what it takes?
