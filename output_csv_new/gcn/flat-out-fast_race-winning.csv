"Race winning intervals are exact simulations of what it takes to win a race by attacking the peloton, escaping and maintaining that gap to the finishline.  Warm up for 10 minutes with 3 x 1 minute fast pedaling drill >110rpm.  Then 5 minutes at tempo.   Now complete 5 x race winning interval.  Each is roughly 3:40 in length. Starting with a sprint like effort for 30 seconds, then riding just above your FTP for 3 minutes and finishing with a 10 second sprint at the end to finish strong.   Rest well between each for 4 minutes.  Cool-down.",1,600,25,75,%,,,,,,
