"This ride is what we refer to as ""Over Under's"". Over Under is when you go above FTP (100%) to below FTP (<100%). During this ride you will perform 4 sets of 30 seconds over your threshold at 105% of your FTP followed by 30 seconds under your threshold at 85% of your FTP for 4-minutes. Imagine going back and forth from Vo2 to Sweet Spot. Between each set you will have 2 minutes of recovery.",1,180,60,60,%,,,,,,
