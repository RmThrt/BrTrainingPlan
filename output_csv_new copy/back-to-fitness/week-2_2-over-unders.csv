"This workout is based on the well documented 'over - under' style workout, where you repeatedly tip yourself above and dip below your threshold power. You should get plenty of rest during the 1 minute at 90% of FTP to enable you to manage the 2 minutes spent slightly above your threshold.",1,300,40,105,%,,,,,,
