"SST Intervals are part of our continued effort to build and maintain base. Warm up with 15 minutes at Endurance with 2 x 1 minute Fast Pedals to wake up your legs (as fast as you can pedal without bouncing in the saddle). Then 2 x 15 minute intervals in the ""Sweet Spot"" zone with 5 minutes recovery in-between. Ride the rest of the time in Level 2 Endurance zone.Cadence: 85 - 105",1,900,25,75,%,,,,,,
