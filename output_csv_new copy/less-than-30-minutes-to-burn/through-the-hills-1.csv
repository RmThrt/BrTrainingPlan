"The hills are here! This workout will simulate running up and over hills. You can think of hills as speedwork in disguise. Hills are a great way to do speedwork if you are tired, because the focus is more on strength and fitness than speed and coordination. The messaging will suggest when to change grades and to what % incline. As always, if the paces are too easy or too hard make adjustments to what feels right.",1,480,65,80,%,,,,,,
