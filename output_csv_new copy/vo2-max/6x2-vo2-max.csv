"Here we are again with some 2 minutes at upper VO2 zone. This is the hardest sustained efforts we'll complete for this plan, but I think you are ready. It's really important to mentally find a place to go where you can get through these efforts with a good attitude. No way around it, these hurt. Using those fast RPM's will absolutely help here as you just have to keep the trainer from bogging you down here. A warm up, and then 6x's 2 minutes at 120% with 2 minutes break between. Be ready, these efforts will feel like they are coming FAST!",1,540,45,65,%,,,,,,
