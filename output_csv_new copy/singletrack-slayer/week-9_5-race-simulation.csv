"MTB racing places the rider under some extreme circumstances. High power with low cadence, and long threshold efforts are just some examples of what you will experience racing.This is a race-simulation session, with intervals that are representative of a race, that also works on your threshold power. So not only will you get a taste of racing, but you will get a good training benefit too.",1,300,42,70,%,,,,,,
