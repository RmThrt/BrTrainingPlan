"Stone roller, gravel crusher, pebble pounder are all things you can call yourself after completing UNBOUND! We have a climbing-focused workout planned for today that features surging and recovery. Over the 10 minute intervals, we'll switch between 4 min efforts at a moderate cadence just below FTP to 1 min low cadence work above FTP to mimic a steep section of the Flint Hills. UNBOUND Gravel is a grassroots event, organized and managed by folks who are passionate about cycling, and have done so for the primary purpose of providing life-enriching cycling experiences for event participants.",1,420,60,90,%,,,,,,
