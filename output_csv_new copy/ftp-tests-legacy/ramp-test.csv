"How much can you handle? It's time to find out. The Ramp Test will ramp up the power in 20-watt increments every minute until you simply cannot keep going. This test is designed to quickly identify the upper limit of your aerobic capacity and estimate your FTP (functional threshold power). The ramp portion will ideally take 5–20 minutes to complete. It should easy at first, but then get very hard very fast. Stay seated, keep a steady cadence, and keep ramping up until you simply cannot continue.     Note that this test is designed for more experienced and/or heavier riders. For small riders or beginners, try the Ramp Test Lite, which uses a more gradual power ramp to achieve the same results.",1,300,0,0,0,,,,,,
