"This workout contains 4 x pyramids - ramping up and down in each effort so, maxing out at 100% of your FTP. Whilst the power isn't excessively high - the challenge comes from having to produce varying power at a high cadence of 110rpm. Being able to maintain a high cadence whilst your power is constantly changing is a skill, and will help support a more efficient pedaling style when you revert back to your normal, lower cadence.",1,300,40,105,%,,,,,,
