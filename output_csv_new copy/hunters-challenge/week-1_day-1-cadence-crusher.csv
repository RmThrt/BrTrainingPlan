"Welcome to Hunter's Challenge. These 28 workouts should be done in 28 days if you think you're a Zwift superhero. If you need a rest day or 2, go for it. Nobody's looking. Honest.Cadence is 1st priority and then intensity. KEEP THE RPM and strive for the wattages. This is a great workout to teach your leg muscles to produce the same power but at high RPM. If 100 RPM is ""normal"" for you then add 10 more RPM to them.",1,420,40,75,%,,,,,,
