"Riding in the peloton requires plenty of speed and cadence changes, along with sustained output.It's important that you are ready for those changes, and doing this workout will help!Warm-up for 10 minutes and then do 3 x 1 minute fast pedaling drills at >110rpm with 1 minute at 80rpm between each.   Then begin a 40minute block at tempo pace, 80% of FTP, and do a ""burst"" for 15 seconds every two minutes.  Each burst is at 120% of FTP, and return to previous pace of 80% of FTP after each.
