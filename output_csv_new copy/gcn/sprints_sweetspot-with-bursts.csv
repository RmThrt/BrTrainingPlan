"This workout isn't only about improving your sprint, but it's about improving your ability to sprint after doing a nice solid pace at 88-93% of your FTP, or what is called sweetspot and then recovering after.Warm-up well with 3 x 1 minute fast pedals at >110rpm, then 5minutes of tempo, followed by 35 minutes of riding at sweetspot, and doing a 20 second ""burst"" every two minutes.  The burst will be at 80% of your sprint effort, but still hard.  Be sure to recover back to your previous pace.   Cool-down",1,600,25,75,%,,,,,,
