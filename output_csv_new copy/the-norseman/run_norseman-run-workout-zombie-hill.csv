"So you think you have what it takes to take on the Norseman Workout Series? This run workout is named after the section of the run course known as Zombie Hill. The first 15 miles of the Norseman run are a chance to make good progress, gently rolling around a lake. Take a sharp left turn in Rjukan and you'll start climbing the hairpins of Zombie Hill. This is the point in the race when most competitors downgrade to survival mode.	This workout starts with a 10 minute progressive warm up followed by two 30 second strides to get the heart rate up and the legs prepped. The main set of 10 x 1 minutes hill reps which will build in gradient from efforts 1-4 and then 5-8 and then something special for reps 9 and 10. In-game messaging will direct your treadmill incline changes. Between each 1 minute hill rep, we will be kind enough to give you 1 minute of rest, just don’t forget there’s no resting on race day. At the conclusion of the main set we will warm down with 6 minutes of decreasing effort.	Think you have what it takes?
