"So you think you have what it takes to take on the Norseman Workout Series? The halfway point comes and goes and you are still feeling strong. A couple of miles before Rjukan you turn a gentle corner and there in front of you looms the mountain. If you squint you can see the aerial that marks the finish line of the race, the small matter of 5200ft (1600m) to climb between now and then.This run workout is aimed to build on our 3 x 6 minute Tempo builds by upping the duration to 10 minute intervals. The goal is to build some speed and resiliency so you can float across the flats of the run course before attacking that final climb. 	This workout starts with a 10 minute progressive warm up, and then goes straight into the main set of three 10 minute tempo builds. Nothing fancy just some good hard efforts. This 50 minute workout will wrap up with a 4 minute decreasing effort cooldown.	Think you have what it takes?
