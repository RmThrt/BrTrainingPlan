"So you think you have what it takes to take on the Norseman Workout Series? Thank goodness the bike is over. All that elevation is in your legs as you jog out of T2 in picturesque Austbygde, smiling and high fiving your support crew in the process. Just a marathon left, all you can think about is that famous black jersey.This run workout brings the speed and is aimed to help push your threshold. Intervals just below threshold will make your legs strong and fast, so no skipping out on interval day. 	This workout starts with a 8 minute progressive warm up followed by two 30 second strides to get the heart rate up and the legs prepped. The main set is made up of five 5 minute intervals. 25 minutes of really high quality work. This 50 minute workout will wrap up with a 4 minute decreasing effort cooldown.
