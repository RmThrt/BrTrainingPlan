"A huge discovery. As spectacular as the performances offered by young Spaniard Sara Martín during 2021 is the potential still in her pockets for the upcoming years. An impressive, all-around talent, a strong time trialist, and a solid climber, with attacking spirit and huge tactical intelligence, the rider from Aranda de Duero, Burgos, surprised the world already from her first top-ranked races last year. This is an easy ride with various cadence intervals from 65%, 62%, 60% of FTP with cadence changes from  95, 105, and 115 rpms to develop leg coordination.",1,300,45,65,%,,,,,,
