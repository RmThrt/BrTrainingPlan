This workout is the first to include some higher intensity as we introduce some short efforts of 20 - 40sec to 'prime' your aerobic system before a 10 min block just below your FTP. These priming efforts prior to your 10 min interval means that we will have depleted your anaerobic system slightly before you do the 10min efforts which are done below your FTP. The 10 min blocks will feel slightly harder than normal because of the short depleting intervals prior. You will have just a total of 3 min above your FTP in this session but 20min just below.,1,480,40,80,%,,,,,,
