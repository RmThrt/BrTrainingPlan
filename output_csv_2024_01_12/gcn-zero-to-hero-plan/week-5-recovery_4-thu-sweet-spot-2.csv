"We'll be working at sweet spot (SST) zone today, featuring an extensive 20min effort ramping up from 85% to 91% FTP. This makes us efficient at riding at a high pace during the day of racing. The session is finished with 8 x 1 min efforts right at FTP. FTP efforts feel a lot harder after spending 20 mins at SST, so be prepared :-)",1,180,45,60,%,85,,,,,
