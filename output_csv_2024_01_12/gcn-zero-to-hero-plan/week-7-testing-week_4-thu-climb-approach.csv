"Today's training is set up to mimic the real life scenery that takes place in racing when there is a climb approaching. Initially there is a large surge in speed for positioning into the bottom of the climb. Then, typically a small lull in pace as your team takes control of the throttle. After it has lined out, you typically are sitting right on threshold waiting for the first brave person to attack. Make sure you can follow the attack today!",1,600,39,95,%,85,,,,,
