"Lactate is a fuel source for your body. Using this knowledge we can add an additional trigger to your lactate shuttling system.By first raising lactate levels to a high concentration in the opening effort, we can then maintain this level for an extended period with balanced interval training.This is achieved by exercising at a level that represents a balance between lactate accumulation and lactate combustion.",1,180,45,55,%,,,,,,
