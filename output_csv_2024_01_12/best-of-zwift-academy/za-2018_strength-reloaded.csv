"This session was a favorite from Zwift Academy 2017! This time with a little twist...The first part is designed to squeeze you. Working your strength and ability to generate power through high-torque efforts. Finishing the session with some 1 x 1 minute efforts, these simulate rolling through in a group, pushing hard on the front and having to maintain the power for the 'recovery' element.",1,180,45,60,%,,,,,,
