"This final session for the 2018 Zwift Academy was another favorite from 2017! This time with a little extra...Last year we went up to the 4/1minute rep, this year we take it over the top and back down again! The main intervals are 7 x 5 minutes with 3 minutes easy spinning between efforts, starting just above threshold then settling into high Zone 3 (comfortably hard, but hardly comfortable).This is pushing your threshold up. Working up the pyramid isn't too difficult, it is the return-leg when it starts to bite! Hang in and try and keep the power where it needs to be.",1,180,55,55,%,,,,,,
