"This session can be classified as short, high-intensity interval (HIIT) reps. Basically, all repetitions are under 1 minute in duration. Short HIIT sessions are easy to manipulate, allowing you to target different areas of your physiology. And of course, with the recovery being short, the aerobic system plays a pivotal role as well. If you’re looking for a workout to tick all the boxes, this is it! But hold on tight, because it’s not going to be easy.        This workout consists of 4x6 minute reps, broken into two rounds of 50 seconds at above FTP and only allows for 10 seconds of recovery. Then you’ll hit it hard for 40 seconds above FTP again with just 20 seconds recovery. And finally, you’ll crush 30 seconds above FTP with 30 seconds recovery to close it out.         For WHOOP users — This workout is ideally done on a Green Recovery day. The short, sharp intervals will help you rack up a solid strain score. If you aren’t well recovered, get some rest and complete this workout on another day.",1,600,45,80,%,,,,,,
