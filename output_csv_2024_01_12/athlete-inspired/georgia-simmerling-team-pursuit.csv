"Georgia Simmerling won the bronze medal in the team pursuit in 2016 and is the first Canadian to compete in 3 different sports in 3 Olympic games (cycling, alpine skiing, and skicross). The team pursuit is a short and VERY intense event on the track which requires enormous wattage to be successful. This workout will take you through what it feels like to push yourself during a team pursuit event.",1,300,55,75,%,,,,,,
