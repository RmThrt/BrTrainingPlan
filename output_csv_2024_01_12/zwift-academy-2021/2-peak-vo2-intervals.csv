"If you've ever seen a rider attack hard in the last leg of a race or explode over short steep climbs, they're using the efforts learned in this workout. Let's get after it.      This session is focused on stressing your peak VO2 early in each interval, then maintaining that level of oxygen consumption before continuing at a level that really works your aerobic system. Performing six reps will stress your aerobic capacity along with your lactate clearance abilities, something that's crucial for recovering between segments.
