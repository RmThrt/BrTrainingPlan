"This session aims to replicate the demands of a mountain bike ride / event. Mountain biking generally involves far more variations in effort compared with road riding - so plenty of surges and time spent being over geared!We touch upon all of these aspects in todays session, as we ramp our effort up at a low cadence to replicate climbing a technical section, picking our way around rocks, before a Z4 effort on a fire road, before heading back in to the forest and up a really steep technical section where once again we are forced to ride at an uncomfortably low cadence, in the saddle!",1,600,25,75,%,,,,,,
