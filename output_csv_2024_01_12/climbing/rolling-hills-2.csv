"This endurance session focuses on replicating the demands of outdoor rolling hills. Just like outdoors, we have a targeted lower cadence for the hills, with the power between hills just under threshold. The body of this workout involves repeated high intensity efforts ranging in length from 30 to 40sec.",1,300,45,75,%,,,,,,
