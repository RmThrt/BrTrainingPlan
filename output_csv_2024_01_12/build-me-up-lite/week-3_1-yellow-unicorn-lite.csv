"Another week, another unicorn workout! Today, we'll keep the under portion the same as last week but progress the over portion by 30sec! So, after a warm-up, we'll do 6x (2min under and 1min over), then cool down. Get ready to push yourself a bit more today, but you are strong!",1,300,25,75,%,,,,,,
