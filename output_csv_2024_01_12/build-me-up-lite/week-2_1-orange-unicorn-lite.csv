"Making workouts less monotonous and fun is a crucial aspect of indoor training. Over/unders is an excellent way to accomplish this. Today's workout is the next step in our over/under workout series. After a warm-up, we'll go into 2 sets of 6x (2min under and 30sec over), then cool down. We're pushing the under this week by another minute, but I know you are up for it!",1,300,25,75,%,,,,,,
