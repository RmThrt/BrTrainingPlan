The first and third block are at 88% of FTP (top-end of Zone 3), with the middle block a Free Ride, so you can ride as hard or easy as you like (target being to complete another Zone 3 block).This is another purist way to develop your endurance - no free wheeling and consistent muscle tension.",1,480,35,95,%,,,,,,
