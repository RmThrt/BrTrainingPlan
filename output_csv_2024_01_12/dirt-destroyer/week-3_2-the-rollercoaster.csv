"This Rollercoaster session aims to replicate the demands of a mountain bike ride / event. Mountain biking generally involves far more variations in effort compared with road riding - so plenty of surges and time spent being over geared!We touch upon all of these aspects in todays session, as we complete two blocks of alternating intensity, with top end Zone 6 surges thrown in there to replicate the demands of having to get up and over a steep bank or technical section. Feel free to get out of the saddle during the max efforts if you need to.We also have a 12 minute Sweet Spot effort in the middle, to help continue to develop our endurance.",1,600,25,75,%,,,,,,
