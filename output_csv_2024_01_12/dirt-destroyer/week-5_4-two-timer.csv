"Todays workout contains some ramped efforts, at varying cadences.We will complete 2 x 15 minute blocks, each containing a two consecutive ramps, with the first at a low cadence of 60rpm, followed by a short block of 'Over-Unders' where we tip above and under your threshold before a big 30 second push at the end.We spend a lot of time today around your threshold, but critically not AT threshold, which is more aligned to the demands of mountain biking.",1,420,44,75,%,,,,,,
