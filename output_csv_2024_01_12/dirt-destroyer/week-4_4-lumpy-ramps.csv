"This session aims to replicate the demands of a mountain bike ride / event, by constantly changing the intensity at which we ride at! Not only does the power demand change, but so does your cadence.Half of the 'ramp up's' are to be completed at a low cadence of 65rpm, whilst the other half are at your chosen cadence. Meanwhile, the 'ramp down's' are to be completed at a more familiar cadence of 85rpm.The efforts we complete today are typical of a tough mountain bike ride / race, where you could be riding through any sort of terrain that has varying terrain!",1,600,25,75,%,,,,,,
