"The goal of this exercise is to start out too hard in order to load up the system, and then demand a steady output for a short period of time, then scaling back in order to prevent from exploding, and forcing you to hold just at your threshold power or a touch above. In the end you finally ramp back up in order to push in the very end.",1,900,55,72,%,,,,,,
