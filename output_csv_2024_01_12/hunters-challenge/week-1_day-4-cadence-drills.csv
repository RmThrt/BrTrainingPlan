Don't worry too much with watts or HR in this one. Just make it a fun and challenging trainer ride. 10 minutes fast warm-up with Cadence in 90-95 range and at 75% of FTP or 80% of FT HR. Then a 5 minute rest followed by 20 minutes of sweet spot pedaling with 10 bursts for 20 seconds each.,1,600,55,72,%,,,,,,
