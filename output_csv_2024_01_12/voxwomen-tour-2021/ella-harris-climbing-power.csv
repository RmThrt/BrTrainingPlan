"We have a climbing-focused workout planned for today. Ella Harris says: ""This workout develops my ability to climb and recover over different gradients. Over the 10 minute intervals, we’ll switch between 4 min efforts at a moderate cadence just below FTP, to 1 min low cadence work above FTP to mimic a steep section.""",1,420,60,90,%,,,,,,
