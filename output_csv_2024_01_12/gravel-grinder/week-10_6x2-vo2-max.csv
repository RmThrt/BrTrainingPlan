"Here we are again with some 2min at upper VO2 zone. This is the hardest sustained efforts we'll complete for this plan, but I think you are ready. It's really important to mentally find a place to go where you can get through these efforts with a good attitude. No way around it, these hurt. Using those fast RPMs will absolutely help here as you just have to keep the trainer from bogging you down here. A warm up, and then 6x's 2min at 120% with 2min break between. Be ready, these efforts will feel like they are coming FAST!",1,180,55,55,%,,,,,,
