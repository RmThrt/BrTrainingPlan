"A shorty, but a goody. Getting used to some very high watt efforts, but just for short bursts. These efforts are much different in gravel racing than they would be in a road race situation as it's usually terrain determined with a steep section, but still could be from our competitors and their big surges or finishes. We will do these in free ride mode but I do want the max watts you can do for 30 seconds in these two rounds. Don't do the best 30 seconds you've ever done and then be terrible at the rest. I would love them to be fairly consistent. Also considering we are talking gravel here I want to see you at lower RPMs around 75-80 during this sprint.",1,120,55,55,%,,,,,,
