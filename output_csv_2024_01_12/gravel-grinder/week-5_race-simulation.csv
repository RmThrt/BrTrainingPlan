"The title says it all, this workout is about seeing where you are at and getting you a little peak into what the effort of a segement of a gravel race may be. In many gravel races the separation will occur on a hill or in loose thick gravel sections and you'll have to really put the power down to respond. This workout will be an extended warm up including a threshold block and then into 3 blocks that you could consider climbs. I'll let you pick your RPMs for this round, but know that in a gravel race you'll likely need lower RPMs to maintain traction and because of steepness of the terrain. Enjoy!",1,480,70,70,%,,,,,,
