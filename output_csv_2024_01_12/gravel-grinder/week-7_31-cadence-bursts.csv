"Cadence work today! Working on pedaling efficiency is super important in any racing including gravel. Start working on expanding your cadence array. Can you get your top end cadence a bit higher? We are gonna work on that today. Along with one of my favorite warm-ups and cool-downs, the 5-4-3-2-1 ramp up/down. Enjoy!",1,300,50,50,%,,,,,,
