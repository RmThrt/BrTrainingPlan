"This workout is focused on aerobic conditioning, getting your aerobic system revved up for some harder training session ahead. In this workout we accumulate a total of 20min 'work' with the majority of that in Zone 3. We split this workout into 2 x 10min segments but within each segment we have 2 x 1min bursts above FTP. These 1min bursts are just over FTP at 102%. The perfect session to prepare you for summer riding.",1,480,55,80,%,,,,,,
