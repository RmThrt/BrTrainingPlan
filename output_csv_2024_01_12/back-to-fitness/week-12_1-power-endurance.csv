This ride consists of an integration of POWER + Endurance. The power efforts will be shorter efforts 30 seconds or less in duration followed by a ramp-down style of climbing and endurance decreasing in intensity throughout 5 minutes. We will tap in to all of our energy systems today which keep sessions fun while at the same time challenging for all!,1,60,60,60,%,,,,,,
