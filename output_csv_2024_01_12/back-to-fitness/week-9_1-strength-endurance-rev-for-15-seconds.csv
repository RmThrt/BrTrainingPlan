"Today's workout is about gaining strength, you will spend much of your time in Zone 3, TEMPO, 85% of your FTP - however you want to look at it. During today's workout it is important to be aware of your RPM's - focus on being between 60-65.  If you have knee or back issues increase this to 60-70 RPM's. Keep smooth pedal strokes, no rocking of the hips or mashing from left to right pedal :) At the end of the 5 minutes we will be increasing our cadence and power as much as we can for :15 seconds.  You will want to shift up one or two cogs - feeling the torque but able to ramp it up within the :30 seconds.",1,180,50,50,%,,,,,,
