"Welcome, today we've got 9x3 minute efforts on tap. The bulk of the work isn't overly hard today with a lot of 80% riding but you have to follow the 30 second VO2 effort inside each 3 minute block. 1-3 it's at the beginning. 4-6 it's in the middle. 7-9 it's at the end. Once you're done with that effort, though, you need to settle back into your pace. We never know when the effort is going to come in a race, so might as well practice some little bursts inside of some good work.",1,600,45,65,%,,,,,,
