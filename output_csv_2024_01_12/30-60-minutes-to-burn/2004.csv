"Today's workout, '2004' is the first in a series of 6 workouts designed to help you prepare for Rapha's Festive 500 Challenge - 500km in eight days. Rapha was founded in 2004. You will complete 2 x 15 minute blocks, each containing a 10 minute ramped effort, followed by a short block of 'Over-Unders' where we tip above and under your threshold before a big 30 second push at the end. You will spend a lot of time during todays session just below your threshold power, with a small amount above your FTP - an efficient way to help improve your endurance.",1,480,35,95,%,,,,,,
