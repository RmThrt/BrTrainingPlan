"Big session today! Now that you're into the ZA Semi finals we are going to implement training that targets specific areas of fitness. We open with 6 x 2min Anaerobic Capacity efforts, however the target power increases from 'hard' to 'very hard'! The workout concludes with a 6min VO2 effort featuring the same steady increase in target power.",1,180,50,50,%,,,,,,
