"Welcome to the Garmin UNBOUND Gravel Training Plan! We're starting off with some easy riding this week at zone 2. In zone 2 training we are stimulating your type 1 muscle fibers, also called slow twitch. Spending time in Zone 2 is essential to improving performance and a zone you'll spend a lot of time in during ultra endurance events - like UNBOUND! Zone 2 training is one of the most important aspects of any training plan. We don't always get faster by training faster. UNBOUND Gravel is a grassroots event, organized and managed by folks who are passionate about cycling, and have done so for the primary purpose of providing life-enriching cycling experiences for our event participants.",1,180,50,50,%,,,,,,
