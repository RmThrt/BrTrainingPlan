"This session is focused on helping to build comfort at and around our FTP. This workout consists of periods at a high intensity - 110% FTP, with recovery at a moderate intensity - 78% FTP. Working around threshold values in this way is very effective to push up FTP values, as well as teaching your physiology to produce and use lactate as a fuel source.",1,600,30,78,%,,,,,,
