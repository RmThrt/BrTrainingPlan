"This is our first VO2 Max workout of the gravel training plan, and is a good taste of what's to come. VO2 Max training is necessary to raise your aerobic ceiling and prepare you for the specific demands of very steep climbs. REMINDER: You can always adjust the FTP bias via the arrow keys on your keyboard, or the Zwift Companion app. Once you get over threshold, using a %FTP for workout prescription can get murky, so always adjust as needed.",1,300,40,75,%,,,,,,
