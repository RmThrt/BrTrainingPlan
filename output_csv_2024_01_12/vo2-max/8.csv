Twice through a block of intervals up above threshold power will have you wishing for some extra O2, but you'll have to wait until the cool down to get it. Though there is a nice Zone 2 break between blocks of Z5 intervals where you can grab a little bit of extra air in your lungs.",1,600,25,75,%,,,,,,
