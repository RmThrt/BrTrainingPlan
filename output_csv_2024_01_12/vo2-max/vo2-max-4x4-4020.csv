"This workout features some more VO2 Max work. Today, we'll be aiming for just a little more VO2 Max time, but also incorporating a 40/20 interval approach which will challenge you for sure! Let's make it happen today! REMINDER: You can always adjust the FTP bias via the arrow keys on your keyboard, or the Zwift Companion app. Once you get over threshold, using a %FTP for workout prescription can get murky, so always adjust as needed.",1,300,40,75,%,,,,,,
