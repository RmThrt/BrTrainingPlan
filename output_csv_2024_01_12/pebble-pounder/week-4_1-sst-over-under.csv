"Welcome to Week 4 of the Pebble Pounder! Today, we're going to further our time spent at SST by doing some over/under intervals. These aren't 'true' over/unders, but rather going from 88% FTP to 95% FTP. We'll also be practicing our big gear work today during the 'over' portion.",1,300,40,75,%,0,,,,,
