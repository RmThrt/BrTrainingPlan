"The standard FTP test starts off with a long easy warmup, a few ramps, and a 5 minute effort to get the legs pumping.  After that it's time to give it your all - and go as hard as you can for 20 solid minutes.  Pace yourself and try to go as hard as you can sustain for the entire 20 minutes - you will be scored on the final 20 minute segment.  Upon saving your ride, you will be notified if your FTP improved.",1,1200,30,70,%,,,,,,
