"Today's session consists of sustained cruise intervals. However, each cruise interval is proceeded by a hard Zone 5 interval. Cruise intervals are performed within Zone 4, however we are changing the target power every minute from slightly up and down within a narrow power band. Focus on controlled breathing and pedaling at a cadence similar to your time trial cadence.",1,300,45,75,%,,,,,,
