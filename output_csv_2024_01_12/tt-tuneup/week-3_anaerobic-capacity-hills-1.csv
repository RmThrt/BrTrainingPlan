"Increasing your anaerobic capacity will help you become a stronger cyclist. Anaerobic energy can be used for a short burst at a higher power output than your FTP. To improve your anaerobic capacity we need to produce high power efforts between a range of shorter durations. In this session we replicate AC intervals performed on a climb by adding a target rpm. The climb starts out steady enough, before ramping up to the finish with high power.",1,180,45,60,%,,,,,,
