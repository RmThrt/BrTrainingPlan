"Another threshold focused session that adds an element of MTB specificity. The main set of intervals consist of 7min descending threshold efforts that are preceded by a high intensity 30sec effort. This session closely reflects the demands you will face in a cross country race, with a hard start or surge at the beginning of a long, sustained effort.",1,300,45,70,%,,,,,,
