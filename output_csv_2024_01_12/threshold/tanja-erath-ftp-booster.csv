"Today's workout features 3 sets of progressive intervals. Tanja says ""My FTP Workout is kind of the evergreen of workouts. Almost every minute is filled with a specific plan which makes time fly. It's intense, but not a killer workout. This is my go-to FTP Booster for winter prep, in-between race weeks or mid season break build-up.""",1,480,50,75,%,,,,,,
