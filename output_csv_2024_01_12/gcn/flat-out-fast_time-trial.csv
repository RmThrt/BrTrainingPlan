"One of the tricks of the pros in order to improve their time trialing speed is to do some motorpacing for short distances, but at a fast speed. You are going to simulate these kinds of intervals by doing 4 minute efforts near your FTP and keeping the cadence quick.  Warm-up for 10minutes with 3 x 1 minute fast pedaling intervals >110rpm,  then a solid 5 minutes at tempo to ensure you are ready.  Complete 6 x 4minutes and each interval will get a little easier as you closer to the end of it. At the same time, each interval will require a little faster cadence, so that by the end of the effort, you are over 110rpm.  Recover completely for 3 minutes of endurance riding between each.
