"For this workout, we have a structured warm-up. Then there are two blocks of three-repetition over-under intervals that bracket a long block of free-ride, only for this workout, we leave the natural terrain of Zwift turned ON. So pick a route with some challenging terrain - in the middle of this workout you will be free-riding, but you will still feel the terrain. A nice mix here of structure and nature variance.",1,300,55,75,%,,,,,,
