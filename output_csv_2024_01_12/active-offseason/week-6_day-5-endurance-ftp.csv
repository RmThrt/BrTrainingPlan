"We're building endurance today! Warmup followed by 3 sets of fast pedals (as fast as you can pedal without bouncing in the saddle) to open up the legs, followed by a long endurance ride. Focus on staying relaxed on the bike while keeping your cadence between 85 - 105 rpm. During the ride, you will complete 2 x 20 minute intervals at FTP. The last half hour of the ride keeps it at Tempo pace. This will help boost your stamina and late race performance!",1,600,25,75,%,,,,,,
