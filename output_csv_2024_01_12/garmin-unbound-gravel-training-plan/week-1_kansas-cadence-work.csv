"Today we have a zone 2-focused workout featuring low cadence intervals. The Flint Hills of Kansas - where UNBOUND takes place - are notorious for being short, but very steep. Being able to repeatably generate power in a high-torque setting is a key piece to success in the event, and this workout will help improve exactly that. UNBOUND Gravel is a grassroots event, organized and managed by folks who are passionate about cycling, and have done so for the primary purpose of providing life-enriching cycling experiences for event participants.",1,300,30,50,%,85,,,,,
