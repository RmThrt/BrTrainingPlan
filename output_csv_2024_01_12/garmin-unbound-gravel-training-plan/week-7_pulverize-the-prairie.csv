"The final training week of the training plan, you made it! Time to pulverize the prairie or Attack your way into the base of the Flint Hills climbs today. By performing a high-powered effort at the base of a climb, you will build up some lactate before completing a zone 4 effort. This will help with being able to tolerate lactate as well as recover after hard efforts. But, to make things more specific to the short and steep Flint Hills, today is all about high crank torque. UNBOUND Gravel is a grassroots event, organized and managed by folks who are passionate about cycling, and have done so for the primary purpose of providing life-enriching cycling experiences for event participants.",1,420,45,75,%,,,,,,
