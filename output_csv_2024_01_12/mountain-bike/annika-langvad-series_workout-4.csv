Today's session is all about lactate tolerance. Teaching your body to be able to deal with lactate after such efforts and continue at a steady state is vital to getting through stages as fast a possible.The workout is focused on Z4 interspersed with 30 sec sprints. This type of workout is where it starts to get uncomfortable for me but it helps to keep the eye on the prize. We will start by doing two shorter accelerations in the warm up to get you used to the effort before we move into the main body of the session.,1,420,44,75,%,,,,,,
