"This third workout is a continuation of the endurance build. Structured much like the first workout this session increases the intensity and also omits the breaks between the three sets. It should still feel ""do-able"" but put you under a bit of pressure towards the end of the workout.This workout also has a focus on higher RPM's in the first 5 minutes of each block. This will prep you for the situations where you will have to spin faster in the stages and in this workout also serves the purpose of trying to loosen the legs from Z4 much as you would try to do out on the trails.",1,300,44,75,%,,,,,,
