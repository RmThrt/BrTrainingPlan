"For a MTB rider, raising the power you can produce at threshold is of paramount importance.This supra-threshold session of 4x 5 minutes will have you working at just above your anaerobic threshold power. But be prepared for the sting in the tail! The effort is completed with a low cadence, high power burst. This is just like what you would experience when powering over a steep dirt hill.",1,300,42,70,%,,,,,,
