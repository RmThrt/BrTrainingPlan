"Today's workout features 2 sets of short and sharp intervals. Lauren describes it as: ""I love power style workouts in order to prepare for hard one day races. This High intensity interval (HIT) session gets my blood pumping and legs burning and when I can complete it and not be 'dead' then I know I'm ready to race. This is a great work out for preparing for the classics and more sprint style races. My coach Cedric Barre is the brains behind the pain!"".",1,600,50,75,%,,,,,,
