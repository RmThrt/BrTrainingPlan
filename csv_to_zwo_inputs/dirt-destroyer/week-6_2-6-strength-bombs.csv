"This workout can be likened to a race with a hard start - a steady middle and a hard finish as we complete 2 blocks of efforts at 110% of FTP (Zone 5 - Vo2 Max), with a 10 minute block of Zone 3 (82% of FTP) in the middle. We are going to complete all 6 of the Zone 5 efforts at a low cadence (65rpm) to simulate being stuck on a really steep section, where you are having to navigate around rocks. You will likely produce a fairly erratic pedaling style as your power output varies significantly from pedal stroke to pedal stroke!You will notice the second block of efforts is a lot harder, as we will have the first block of efforts already in our legs - plus the 10 minute aerobic effort too.",1,420,44,75,%,,,,,,
