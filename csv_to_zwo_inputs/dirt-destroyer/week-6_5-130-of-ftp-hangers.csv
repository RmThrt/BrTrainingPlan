"Congratulations on reaching the final workout in the Dirt Destroyer. This sessions aims to develop your Anaerobic Capacity - your ability to produce a lot of power for a short period of time. We complete efforts at 135% of FTP, whilst reducing the amount of rest we get between each effort - meaning each effort will get progressively harder.If you look at the demands of Mountain Biking, you are frequently making efforts up around 135%+ of your FTP, to tackle obstacles and get up steep climbs. The effort durations vary significantly, which is what we are looking to train today - your ability to produce big power, once already fatigued, on limited recovery!",1,600,25,85,%,,,,,,
