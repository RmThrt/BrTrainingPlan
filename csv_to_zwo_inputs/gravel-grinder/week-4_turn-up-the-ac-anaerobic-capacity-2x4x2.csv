"Y'all wanna do some anaerobic work? No? Well, you're gonna do it anyways. You would be correct to think this kind of effort isn't as important in gravel racing, but you'd be wrong to think it still wont benefit you. And besides, it's fun. This is possibly a higher watt than you are used to hitting on the trainer, so please set yourself up to be successful by being ready with high RPMs and a positive attitude!",1,120,45,45,%,,,,,,
