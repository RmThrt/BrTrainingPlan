    <description>This will be the final test effort of the 2018 Zwift Academy! You can use this test to gauge any improvements you may have made; take the average power of the two intervals, this correlates well to a traditional 20 minute effort. Use the average power from the first 12 minutes as a target to push your 20 minute power to within the next 2 - 4 months of training. Treat each 12 minute interval as if it were the only effort. We generally expect the first interval to be ~20 Watts higher than the second. Give it FULL-GAS!</description>
