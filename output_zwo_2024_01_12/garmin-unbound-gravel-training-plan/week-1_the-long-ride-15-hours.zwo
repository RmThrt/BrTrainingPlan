    <description>Just ENJOY today. You have a few options. Ride around the amazing Worlds on Zwift, join in a Zwift group ride, or head outdoors - ideally on your gravel bike and off-road. The goal is to aim for 1.5 hours of endurance riding. Ride on feel today at a 3-5/10 perceived exertion level (RPE).</description>
